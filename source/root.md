## Interesting Texts

This first one is a set of rules that have served me well.
They came to live in various discussions with colleagues.
Not much has changed, but they served well for ~15 years.

- [[misc.rules]]

This is a collection of interesting texts that I have come across.
They are mostly copy/pasted from the original source.

- [[misc.as-a-software-developer]]
- [[misc.secrets-in-systems-engineering]]
- [[misc.programming-sucks]]
- [[misc.is-a-software-engineer-an-engineer]]

## Knowledge Base

- [[CodeKata]]
- [[bash]]
- [[semantic-line-breaks]]
- [[kubernetes]]
- [[python]]
- [[windows]]

## Note Taking

**IMPORTANT**: Always use [[semantic-line-breaks]]

- Currently using [Foam (foambubble.github.io)](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) for note taking.
  - <https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/getting-started/recommended-extensions>

- [[note-taking-dendron]] -- it was nice using this.
  But it is not maintained any longer.
