If WASM+WASI existed ...
========================

.. epigraph::

    If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to created Docker.
    That's how important it is.
    Webassembly on the server is the future of computing.
    A standardized system interface was the missing link.
    Let's hope WASI is up to the task!
