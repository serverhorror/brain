Working with :ref:`virtual-labs-index` seems like a good way to learn new things.
It can provide an interesting addition to the usual HackerRank or CodeWars challenges.

Interesting Texts
-----------------

This first one is a set of rules that have served me well.
They came to live in various discussions with colleagues.
Not much has changed, but they served well for ~15 years.

- :ref:`misc-rules`

This is a collection of interesting texts that I have come across.
They are mostly copy/pasted from the original source.

- :ref:`misc-as-a-software-developer`
- :ref:`misc-secrets-in-systems-engineering`
- :ref:`misc-is-a-software-engineer-an-engineer`
- `Programming Sucks (stilldrinking.org) <https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks>`_
- `Minimize Code, Maximize Data (database-programmer.blogspot.com) <https://database-programmer.blogspot.com/2008/05/minimize-code-maximize-data.html>`_

## Knowledge Base

- [[CodeKata]]
- [[bash]]
- [[semantic-line-breaks]]
- [[kubernetes]]
- [[python]]
- [[windows]]

* :ref:`projects`

## Note Taking

**IMPORTANT**: Always use [[semantic-line-breaks]]

- Currently using [Foam (foambubble.github.io)](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) for note taking.
  - <https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/getting-started/recommended-extensions>

- [[note-taking-dendron]] -- it was nice using this.
  But it is not maintained any longer.

### Google AIPs
