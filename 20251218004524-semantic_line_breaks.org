* Semantic Line Breaks Specification (SemBr)


  The key words “must”, “must not”, “required”, “shall”, “shall not”,
  “should”, “should not”, “recommended”, “may”, and “optional” in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in
  [[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt][RFC 2119]].

When writing source documentation in a format such as Markdown,
reStructuredText or AsciiDoc,
I recommend you place every sentence on its own line and don't use fixed-column word-wrapping.

#+begin_src markdown
# Advantages

- It prevents reflows
  (meaning a change early in the paragraph
    won't cause the remaining lines in the paragraph to reposition),
    which ensures code diffs look more clean.
- It lets you swap sentences more easily.
- It lets you separate and join paragraphs more easily.
- It lets you comment out sentences or add commentary to them.
- You can spot sentences which are too long or sentences that vary
  widely in length.
- You can spot redundant (and thus mundane) patterns in your writing.
- You can easily apply bulk actions on sentences with editor macros,
  such as converting to list items by prepending a dash to each line.
- It improves using GitHub's “suggest changes” workflow,
  as it lets your reviewer start a new suggestion for each sentence
    instead of having to combine them.
