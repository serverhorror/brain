> ## ... on Infrastructure
> 
> * There is one system, not a collection of systems.
> * The desired state of the system should be a known quantity.
> * The "known quantity" must be machine parseable.
> * The actual state of the system must self-correct to the desired state.
> * The only authoritative source for the actual state of the system is the
>   system.
> * The entire system must be deployable using source media and text files.
> 
> ## ... on Buying Software
> 
> * Keep the components in the infrastructure simple so it will be better
>   understood.
> * All products must authenticate and authorize from external, configurable
>   sources.
> * Use small tools that interoperate well, not one "do everything poorly"
>   product.
> * Do not implement any product that no one in your organization has
>   administered.
> * "Administered" does not mean saw it in a rigged demo, online or otherwise.
> * If you must deploy the product, hire someone who has implemented it before
>   to do so.
> 
> ## ... on Automation
> 
> * Do not author any code you would not buy.
> * Do not implement any product that does not provide an API.
> * The provided API must have all functionality that the application provides.
> * The provided API must be tailored to more than one language and platform.
> * Source code counts as an API, and may be restricted to one language or
>   platform.
> * The API must include functional examples and not requre someone to be an
>   expert on the product to use.
> * Do not use any product with configurations that are not machine parseable
>   and machine writeable.
> * All data stored in the product must be machine readable and writeable by
>   applications other than the product itself.
> * Writing hacks around the deficiencies in a product should be less work than
>   writing the product's functionality.
> 
> ## ... in general
> 
> * Keep the disparity in your architecture to an absolute minimum.
> * Use [Set Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory) to accomplish this.
> * Do not improve manual processes if you can automate them instead.
> * Do not buy software that requires bare-metal.
> * Manual data transfers and datastores maintained manually are to be avoided.
