## Oh my! ðŸ’€ Docker, Images, Containers

Let's talk these.

When someone talks about _Docker_, they usually mean _containers_ in general.
It is quite likely that they have not used anything else but the `docker` command or _Docker Desktop_.
That is absolutely OK.
Let's clarify some vocabulary:

* **Container** â€” that's the thing runs anything you like, a webserver, a database server, an email server, â€¦
* **Container Image** â€” this is what you need to create a container.
  You can't think of it like a cookiecutter.
  You can as many cookie as you like, it will always be the same as long as you use the same image
* **`Dockerfile`** â€” this is what you use to create an image.
  You do **not** have to use a _"`Dockerfile`"_, there are a few options.
  Another options is a general _containerfile_.
  Systems like podman use a containerfile, it is â€” usually â€” compatible with a `Dockerfile`.

How does this look?

```mermaid
%%{ init: { 'flowchart': { 'curve': 'monotoneX' } } }%%

dockerfile[/Dockerfile/]
containerfile[/Containerfile/]
image(Image)
container[Container]

dockerfile & containerfile --> image --> container
```
