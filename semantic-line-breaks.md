# Semantic Line Breaks

Using [[semantic-line-breaks]] is useful.
All text, especially for a [[root#Knowledge Base|Knowledge Base]] should use this!

> ## Semantic Line Breaks Specification (SemBr)
>
> The key words “must”, “must not”, “required”, “shall”, “shall not”, “should”, “should not”, “recommended”, “may”, and “optional” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
>
> 1. Text written as plain text or a compatible markup language may use semantic line breaks.
> 1. A semantic line break must not alter the final rendered output of the document.
> 1. A semantic line break should not alter the intended meaning of the text.
> 1. A semantic line break must occur after a sentence, as punctuated by a period (.), exclamation mark (!), or question mark (?).
> 1. A semantic line break should occur after an independent clause as punctuated by a comma (,), semicolon (;), colon (:), or em dash (—).
> 1. A semantic line break may occur after a dependent clause in order to clarify grammatical structure or satisfy line length constraints.
> 1. A semantic line break is recommended before an enumerated or itemized list.
> 1. A semantic line break may be used after one or more items in a list in order to logically group related items or satisfy line length constraints.
> 1. A semantic line break must not occur within a hyphenated word.
> 1. A semantic line break may occur before and after a hyperlink.
> 1. A semantic line break may occur before inline markup.
> 1. A maximum line length of 80 characters is recommended.
> 1. A line may exceed the maximum line length if necessary, such as to accommodate hyperlinks, code elements, or other markup.
>
> ## One sentence per line
>
> When writing source documentation in a format such as Markdown,
> reStructuredText or AsciiDoc,
> I recommend you place every sentence on its own line and don’t use fixed-column word-wrapping.
>
> ## Advantages
>
> - It prevents reflows (meaning a change early in the paragraph won’t cause the remaining lines in the paragraph to reposition), which ensures code diffs look more clean.
> - It lets you swap sentences more easily.
> - It lets you separate and join paragraphs more easily.
> - It lets you comment out sentences or add commentary to them.
> - You can spot sentences which are too long or sentences that vary widely in length.
> - You can spot redundant (and thus mundane) patterns in your writing.
> - You can easily apply bulk actions on sentences with editor macros, such as converting to list items by prepending a dash to each line.
> - It improves using GitHub’s “suggest changes” workflow, as it lets your reviewer start a new suggestion for each sentence instead of having to combine them.
