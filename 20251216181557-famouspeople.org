- Hedy Lamarr -- fled from abuse;
  became a world famous actress and, just because she could,
  invented a carbonated drink and
  sprinkled on top a wireless/radio torpedo guidance system
  for the allied forces in WW2
  (some say is the basis for bluetooth/wireless connections today)
- Katherine Johnson -- calculated the trajectory for the flight of first American in space;
- the NASA computers -- hired in the 1930s;
  to, literally, compute complex calculations.
  (This is, if I remember correctly, where the term computer originates from).

* TODO Verify These Names
- Alan Shepard (not sure about that part, I believe she did it with pen & paper)
